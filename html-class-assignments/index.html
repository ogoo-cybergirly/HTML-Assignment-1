     <h2> <center> Welcome to my biography </center> </h2>
<p> My name is Ogochukwu Asogwa, I'm a cloud engineering student at Altschool Africa. Student ID ALT/SOE/024/5643.</p>
<p> I choose the cloud engineering track because I was finding it difficult to self-teach cloud and its technology. I recently made a career switch from microbiology to cybersecurity. I am a SOC analyst. Cloud security is a field I fancy, when I learnt about Altschool Africa through Kikimordi's initiative to sponsor 100 women, I took the oppportuniity to learn about cloud like I wanted. </p> 
<p> By the end of this academic session, I hope to be conversant with everything cloud enginnering to fully operate in the cloud environment. I hope to enforce security in all stages of cloud development through my knowledge of cybersecurity.</p>
